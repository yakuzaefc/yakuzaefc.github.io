        <h2><span class="founder-title">Vasileios "Monarch" Fagogenis</span></h2>
        <p>The UFC Lightweight Fighter began his martial arts journey at the age of 11 with training in Soo Bahk Do and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. At 16, he expanded into Kickboxing, Muay Thai, and Kenjutsu, refining his striking precision and mental discipline. By 19, he joined the Panathinaikos Boxing Club, earning a championship title and integrating these skills into MMA training at EFL. At 20, he stepped away from MMA due to issues with aggressive behavior, reignited his passion for kickboxing, and began practicing Taekwondo, blending explosive techniques with his versatile fighting style. at the same time, he achieved championship titles in both boxing and live night, wrestling.

          At 21, he founded Elite Combat Corner, a martial arts organization offering high-quality training in MMA and kickboxing, alongside a retail and e-commerce platform providing martial arts equipment, apparel, and supplements. The organization became a trusted name in the martial arts community, emphasizing resilience, respect, and self-improvement. Recognizing issues with the martial arts industry, particularly unethical practices by some coaches, he sought to bring transparency and authenticity by identifying the best dojo in Attica to advance in MMA and compete in the UFC.

          After a year of Elite Combat Cornerâ€™s success, he elevated his vision by establishing Yakuza EFC, an elite fight club that combines traditional martial arts with advanced technology and realistic scenarios. The club promotes hard work, real-world experience, and old-school martial arts values, continuing his mission to transform the martial arts world.</p>
